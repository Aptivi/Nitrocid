Since v0.1.0, we've been adding new features to the simulated kernel, while providing better experience to all our users! Nitrocid 0.2.0 adds even more features, such as customizable login and home screens, while adding commands and screensavers!

Also, a new, attractive, bold design has been applied to match our current vision and to align with our recent branding changes!

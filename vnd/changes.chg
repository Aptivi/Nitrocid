Nitrocid KS changes
===================

Released August 20th, 2025; version 0.2.0.0 (TP) (mod API 4.0.28.18); codename
Color Fusion

This version of Nitrocid KS is the second major version series released after
the revolutional 0.1.0.0 release that was the most historic event at the time.
Dedicated to providing improved user experience, we've improved our libraries
and our applications to ensure that they're at their highest quality possible.

The v0.2.0.x version series incorporates many major changes, from the kernel
itself to the graphical terminal library, Terminaux, that has been updated to
version 7.0 to provide improved performance of the kernel overall. Not only
that, but we've also worked hard on making sure that this version of Nitrocid
will be faster than never before, increasing your productivity.

The kernel simulation functionality remains Nitrocid's #1 goal, because we
started this project back in 2018 to showcase the simulation process. Over
time, new features landed, and many improvements were made to existing
features.

You are now testing the technical preview of the upcoming version of Nitrocid,
version 0.2.0.0 (Color Fusion). The final release will be distributed early
next year.

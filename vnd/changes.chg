Nitrocid KS changes
===================

Released March 11th, 2024; version 0.1.0.52 (mod API 3.0.25.520); codename
Magic Bloom

=============================================================================

0.1.0.45 - Service Pack 4 (April 24th, 2025)
============================================

This service pack is a big release for the 0.1.0.x that incorporates all
features introduced in the now-EOL 0.1.1.x series, including The Nitrocid
Homepage. This is part of making the project better as we backport all
features from EOL versions to the latest supported LTS release to make sure
that all bugs that are present in those features are fixed.

The Nitrocid Homepage
---------------------

Introducing you to The Nitrocid Homepage, where you can interact with the
simulated system using either your keyboard or your mouse thanks to the latest
Terminaux features that made this implementation possible. This homepage
provides you with the following features:

  - Taking a look at the current system time
  - Showing the three latest RSS feeds
  - Opening various interactive applications
  - Accessing the kernel settings without a shell

This homepage UI can be resized using either your terminal emulator's resize
feature or Terminaux's methods of setting the window geometry. Of course, you
can turn this feature off using the kernel settings from the shell. You can
also log out from the homepage or go back to the shell. You can go back to the
homepage anytime you either log out and log back in, or write "exit" in the
main shell.

More interactive than ever
--------------------------

Nitrocid KS has become more interactive than ever by adding more interactive
TUIs that allow you to more easily manage tasks without the hassle of
memorizing shell commands to perform the same tasks, such as weather forecast
and the language studio. In addition, we've implemented the settings TUI so
that you can configure the kernel without having to go back one page to select
a section; you can now select a section in the first pane, while you can select
a configuration entry in the second pane, all in one interactive TUI!

In addition to that, we've now added full mouse support to countless
interactive applications so that you can now experience the easier-than-ever
kernel. This kernel version is the first one that provides complete mouse
support.

Viewing images
--------------

You can now take a look at images right in your terminal without having to
open an external application on your host computer by using the "preview"
command, pointing it to any file path that points to an image file, with the
following non-exhaustive list of supported formats:

  - .JPG and .JPEG
  - .GIF
  - .PNG
  - .SVG

Thankfully, Terminaux is here to do the job as it uses ImageMagick to process
your images, making the preview tool the most powerful image viewing tool ever
implemented, because of ImageMagick's support for both common and uncommon
image formats that you can consult here:

Beep Synth
----------

This is not a typo; Beep Synth from 2018 is back! This time, we've implemented
it a bit differently, but we've made sure to keep the exact same goal of
playing a MIDI-like beep instrument from your PC speakers. We've changed the
format of the beep synth files (read: single instrument music cue sheet) to
the more powerful JSON file instead of a simple text file so that we can
implement the necessary checks.

Your typical beep synth file now looks like this (an example):

    {
        "name": "Song",
        "chapters": [
            {
                "name": "Chapter 1",
                "synths": [
                    "723 640",
                    "323 750",
                    "424 87"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "Chapter 2",
                "synths": [
                    "400 800",
                    "600 800",
                    "800 800"
                ]
            },
        ]
    }

Beep synths used to look like this:

    KS-BSynth

    - Chapter 1
    323, 64
    323, 750
    424, 87

    - Chapter 2
    400, 500
    800, 1000
    400, 500
    800, 1000

Of course, the command name stays the same, so it's "beepsynth" after all. Now,
go ahead and make us listen to your "beep" synths!

More hashing algorithms
-----------------------

We've added more hashing algorithms to the Nitrocid kernel as part of the
Nitrocid Extras addon packs:

  - CRC32C (Castagnoli)
  - Enhanced SHA256 (SHA3-256)
  - Enhanced SHA384 (SHA3-384)
  - Enhanced SHA512 (SHA3-512)

Please note that you'll have to run Windows 11 24H2 or newer to be able to use
the Enhanced SHA algorithms. Any mod that uses one of the Enhanced SHA
algorithms and is being run on Windows 11 23H2 or older will fail to perform
hashing operations.

=============================================================================

0.1.0.39 - Service Pack 3 (February 25th, 2025)
===============================================

This service pack release is a small patch release that enhances your Nitrocid
KS experience by enhancing existing geatures and fixing bugs left and right. It
also brings in such changes from the upcoming 0.1.2 series to move forward in
further development.

Terminaux 6.x
-------------

We've finally used Terminaux 6.x to make your kernel more attractive than
before. With rounded borders and other interesting changes, your experience is
now more intuitive.

Other Changes
-------------

We've also added some of the features introduced in the 0.1.2 version, such as
all the screensavers introduced in that version, and much more...

=============================================================================

0.1.0.33 - Service Pack 2 (December 22nd, 2024)
===============================================

This service pack release is a small patch release that enhances your Nitrocid
KS experience by enhancing existing geatures and fixing bugs left and right. It
also brings in such changes from the upcoming 0.1.2 series to move forward in
further development.

Removal of Music Player
-----------------------

As we're planning to change the audio subsystem for audio files in BassBoom,
we are planning to remove the music player from Nitrocid KS as an addon to
reduce maintenance burden and to incorporate all improvements to the player in
just one codebase. This will allow us to integrate the music player again as a
Nitrocid KS mod.

Nitrocid LIVE! updates
----------------------

We've decided to temporarily halt distribution of Nitrocid LIVE! as we're
looking for solutions for the build failure.

=============================================================================

0.1.0.23 - Service Pack 1 (September 10th, 2024)
================================================

This service pack release is a long-awaited release that enhances your Nitrocid
KS experience by adding some new features and fixing bugs left and right.

Timers and Stopwatches
----------------------

We've made the UI of both the timer and the stopwatch applications more modern
then before by utilizing the latest design language that Terminaux 5.0
introduced using the rounded corners. In addition to that, you can now see the
full list of all the laps in the stopwatch application, as well as fixed some
issues.

Events and Reminders
--------------------

The list of events and reminders in the calendar textual user interface (TUI)
is now less cluttered, with grouping of all the events in a single day,
including annual events that last two or more days. You'll now see a much
cleaner interface then before when looking for events and reminders. You can
also see events and reminders in a single day by a single key press.

Security Improvements
---------------------

In the login screen, you are now required to sign in to your account before
being able to shut down or reboot the simulated kernel to avoid unwanted
disruptions. This account must either be an administrator or have power
management permissions in order to be able to initiate a shut down or a reboot.

Nitrocid LIVE!
--------------

Initially introduced in 0.1.1.6, you can now try out Nitrocid in a minimal
Windows environment distribution, called Nitrocid LIVE! Based on Windows 11
24H2 Preinstallation Environment (PE), you can try the Windows version of
Nitrocid out without having to install Windows.

Second-gen Configuration Migration
----------------------------------

You can now migrate your old second-gen configuration files, such as those
that 0.0.24.0 or older generates. It supports migrating configurations that
are as old as 0.0.16.0, released on June 12th, 2021!

LibGit2Sharp Security Update
----------------------------

Security notice: LibGit2Sharp has been updated to version 0.30.0 due to a
security bug found in earlier libgit2 versions. For more information, visit

=============================================================================

Nitrocid KS 0.1.0 hosts an innumerable number of changes that will surprise
you with more-than-stellar features and improvements. It also brings a lot of
improvements for both the core kernel and the API for your mods to be even
more powerful. Codenamed Magic Bloom, we've been working on this particular
version for more than a year and a half to bring to you the final version of
the first real beta version of Nitrocid KS!

When you first use Nitrocid KS 0.1.0 after using 0.0.24.0 or earlier, you'll
notice a lot of improvements, especially the speed-related improvements that
makes the simulated kernel be lightning-fast compared to the older versions.
Afterwards, you'll notice a lot of new features and changes being made to
the kernel aesthetics to make everything more clear than before. We've made
a huge amount of improvements to all the different areas of the kernel, from
converting its codebase to C# to employing the kernel addon system to using
Terminaux to host a lot of console features.

We can't list every single change made to the kernel simulator, but we've
repeatedly listed the most hit changes, including the codebase conversion in
the second milestone, implementation of the kernel addons in the third beta,
and the new configuration reader and writer in the first beta. This new
configuration reader and writer ensures that your configuration is handled
not only by the base kernel itself, but also by the kernel addons. In
addition to this, your kernel modifications can now have their own config
classes and their associated entries JSON files to modify the behavior of
your kernel modifications without having to resort to making your own
configuration reader and writer.

The configuration reader and writer has also seen many improvement attempts,
first started on 0.0.16.0 released on June 12th, 2021. Since then, we've been
trying to look for ways to speed them up, and 0.1.0 is the result of all the
hard work thanks to the serialization and the deserialization methods that
accelerated the entire process.

Unfortunately, we've also had to remove .NET Framework 4.8 support, because
we've been using features that are exclusive to the modern .NET versions, such
as .NET 8.0 that this version of the kernel makes use of. Previously, we had
to maintain two copies: .NET Framework, and .NET 6.0. This version now only
supports .NET 8.0, so your computer must have the .NET 8.0 runtime installed.

To help you get the best advice for your mods, we've introduced the kernel mod
code analyzers, which allow you to analyze your own mod code in case of using
the non-trivial ways of certain operations, such as using Console.Write()
instead of the Terminaux-provided text writer. This analyzer will issue
warnings and messages related to your kernel modifications in your IDE,
advising you to seek for alternatives to the operations that you're currently
performing in your mod code.

In celebration of the fifth-year anniversary of the first release of Nitrocid
KS, 0.0.1, we've decided to give the simulated kernel a name: Nitrocid. This
name is a portmanteau of Nitric and Acid with an O letter in the middle of the
name. The "Nitro" part indicates that this kernel runs faster than before due
to recent improvements that we've done, and the "cid" part inicates that this
kernel is more flexible than before. A dedicated theme, NitricAcid, celebrates
this renaming event.

We've also changed the aesthetics when you start the kernel up, indicating
that we've achieved a major milestone throughout the entire project lifetime
from 2018. From the kernel startup to the kernel shell to the interactive
TUIs, we've changed their appearance to fit in with the rest of the Nitrocid
aesthetics that we've envisioned before 0.0.24.0's development even started.

As for the interactive TUIs, we've made interactive console user interfaces to
make performing tasks easier than before, such as the file manager introduced
in this release. You can run this file manager using the "ifm" command. We've
planned for this in 2018, but we've never actually executed it, because we
felt that this task would be more suited for when the kernel would actually
stabilize in its "alpha" stage, which actually finished with the release of
0.0.24.0, which gave us a boilerplate to start working on this awesome
installment!

The interactive file manager now allows you to more easily manage your files.
It contains all the basic file manager features, such as opening folders,
opening files (thanks to the file extension handler that your mods can use to
handle certain extensions not handled by the kernel and its addons), copying
files/folders, deleting them, and so on. We've also made sure that the basic
operations pass the grandmother test for simplicity.

In addition to that, we've introduced the color filter system as an
accessibility feature for color-blind users thanks to Terminaux 3.0. You can
now adjust the kernel colors by changing the color blindness settings in the
kernel configuration system that you can access by executing the "settings"
command in the normal shell.

For the documentation lovers, we've built the documentation on GitBook, and
published it when Beta 1 was released to give you access to more comprehensive
documentation. This documentation hosted on GitBook was more clear than the
older documentation that didn't thoroughly explain everything and applied only
to older versions of Nitrocid KS going back as far as 0.0.6! That version of
the documentation was originally found inside the application as manual pages,
but we've later moved them to the project wiki, which moved to a DocFX site.

The first start-up experience was re-made. This feature was first introduced
in 0.0.16.0 that asked you only to set your own account up. This revamped
version treats newcomers nicer than before and makes them feel more welcome
than before. It also asks you to select your language and infers the language
based on your computer settings. For example, if your computer is set to use
the Dutch language and the Dutch locale, you'll notice that Nitrocid suggests
Dutch as your language, but it doesn't try to force you to use this language;
it leaves your choice of language up to you.

Kernel drivers are interfaces that allow you to modify the kernel's behavior
in different ways, such as coming up with better ways to copy files, delete
files, encrypt a string, write to the console, write debug messages to the
log, and much more to come! Kernel drivers are also customizable by the
kernel settings, and are flexible thanks to being able to register and
unregister your kernel drivers in your mods.

One of the massive improvements done is using the screen feature introduced
in Terminaux. This feature allows you to make your interactive applications
resizable without worrying that your output will become corrupt. Not only can
they become resizable, but they're also buffered in one write to avoid
slowdowns. This led to the spawn of interactive text and hex editors that are
introduced in the third beta of the kernel, and are stabilized to come to the
final version of the kernel. This eases the task of making your interactive
applications flexible to resize operations.

The color wheel has also been re-designed to more visually provide you with
information about your currently-selected color, and technical information
about said color is hidden under an informational box that you can easily
reveal by pressing the I key. This is also introduced in Terminaux, so parts
of Nitrocid 0.1.0 features are released in batches to let other applications
use them to mak their interactive TUIs flexible.

If you depend on other mods to do work for your mods, you can easily achieve
this by using mod dependencies and inter-mod communication! Starting from this
release, you can now fully utilize these features to communicate with other
mods that provide you their list of available functions, properties, and
fields to be able to change your mod's behavior based on them. You can also
open some of your mod's functions, properties, and fields for other mods to
be able to communicate with your mods!

The debug quota was removed in the past for being too slow, but we've come up
with another method to implement this feature, but this time, we've used a
list of printed lines instead of the old-and-slow checking for file line count
method. This way, this feature checks your debug quota faster than before,
therefore killing the biggest and the most notorious performance hit when you
have debug quotas enabled.

When it comes to the kernel shell, we've made it more flexible than before!
Not only you can make your own shells more easily, but you can also make a
list of your commands in easier ways. This way, we've given you a key to be
able to use your own shell with your own commands faster than before, making
you more productive than before! Also, we've introduced the command switches,
allowing you to change your ommand's behavior based on the switches that the
users provided in the shell. The rigidity in the 0.0.24.0 and the earlier
shells have made us do this core re-write to make the entire UESH shell system
more powerful than before, giving you a more streamlined process of
implementing your shells and your commands. What we've introduced to you in
the shell management namespace is left for you as an exercise to surprise you
with a huge amount of management tools waiting for you to use!

We've added a huge amount of screensavers and themes for you to discover.
We've also added a huge amount of features and improvements waiting for you to
discover them!

A huge thanks to everyone, including you, for using the "early access"
versions of the kernel, including the 0.0.1.0 version, but we've now
officially taken away this title from this application as we're close to the
actualization of the real kernel that the future PCs are waiting for!

For those who are still curious about the "early access"-era kernels, you can
still download them from the official GitHub releases page!

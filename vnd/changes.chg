Nitrocid changes
================

Released February 12th, 2026; version 0.2.0.1 (mod API 4.0.28.55); codename
Attractive, Bold, Powerful

Since the release of Nitrocid v0.1.0 back on February 2024, we have been
constantly working on newer versions, including version 0.1.1 that introduced
The Nitrocid Homepage, which provided a hub that included a list of apps to
run, as well as the analog clock widget that showed nicely on the console, and
version 0.1.2 that introduced various new features, such as rounded corners in
all borders to align with the recent design trends, editable widgets in The
Nitrocid Homepage, and more interactive textual user interfaces, complete with
improvements that were made to both the kernel and its dependencies, and
Terminaux was one of them.

As of today, we are introducing you to a completely new version of Nitrocid as
we are progressing further towards the future of both Aptivi, Nitrocid, and
our projects. It has been a year since we were working on this new generation
of the mod API, and we're finally excited to introduce you to this version of
Nitrocid.

However, before guiding you to what's new in this version of Nitrocid, we have
some of the greatest news ever! Events that happened since January 2026 have
proven to be significant, and we are very excited to present you the biggest
milestone that happened today!

  - The brand new Aptivi branding!
    Since 2022, we have settled on a name that suited our visionary aspect
    into the future of technology, and Aptivi as a whole means "adaptation."
    This sets out an important message that technology evolves quickly, and
    that adaptation is needed to ensure continuity. The triangle in the logo
    holds a message that we are always looking forward for the better future
    when it comes to tech, which is why we gave it "Prism of the Tech Future."
    Now, we gave the Aptivi branding a more unique identity while making it
    bolder and stronger, by introducing new shades of purple that pop, while
    adapting to AMOLED requirements to save battery life for devices that use
    this display technology on their screen panels. Not only we have changed
    the branding and the logo, but we've also changed pretty much everything
    from the website to the API documentation and everything else. This gives
    a new look and feel, while preserving our message.

    The official branding kits are now available to download from our official
    Aptivi website directly instead of via Google Drive or any other cloud
    storage. This gives you instant access to these assets, knowing that those
    kits fall under the branding guidelines, which you can see by visiting
    this link: https://aptivi.github.io/branding/guidelines.

  - Celebrating the 8th year anniversary of Nitrocid
    Although we are 10 days early into celebrating the 8th year release
    anniversary of Nitrocid, which started with a very minimal kernel and
    shell simulator, we are very excited to announce that, this February 22nd,
    marks the 8th year anniversary of the release of the first version of
    Nitrocid, which is 0.0.1. From a very small kernel simulator that only
    works on Windows using the legacy .NET Framework to a beautiful, modern
    textual operating system simulator that provides a huge amount of commands
    and features, as well as screensavers and themes, all written with cross-
    platform support in mind and with the new .NET 10.0 release. We have also
    reached more than 8,000 commits, marking a long history of Nitrocid that
    went through maintenance, additions, and releases for eight years.

  - Revival of ancient Nitrocid documentation
    As part of the archival project for old documentation, we have finally
    revived the wiki source of the Nitrocid documentation that contained the
    full list of commits that were made from the release of 0.0.7 in 2019 to
    0.0.23 in 2022, prior to the last alpha version series, which is 0.0.24.
    Our official GitBook documentation for the project now includes all
    versions of Nitrocid that provided documentation from 0.0.6 to 0.0.23,
    alongside versions 0.0.24 and higher. This is done for preservation and
    archival purposes.

  - Nitrocid 0.1.0 Service Pack 6
    This service pack of the base version of the whole v0.1.x series has
    introduced features that existed in 0.1.2 to this version of the series as
    0.1.2 officially goes end of life. This service pack includes all changes
    that have been made to the 0.1.2 branch, plus some of the additional
    stability changes to make Nitrocid faster and more stable. There are three
    service packs left, with two planned for this year. This release is now
    available on the official release channels (GitHub, Launchpad PPA, Arch
    Linux AUR, and Chocolatey).

  - Nitrocid 0.1.2 became EOL
    As announced earlier this day, we've officially ended all support for
    Nitrocid 0.1.2 in preparation for this massive release. This end of
    support timeline was overdue, but it was delayed due to shifts in
    development of the version that we'll be talking about here.

Now, we're going to add the most significant event to the huge milestone, and
that is...

-----------------------------| Nitrocid 0.2.0! |------------------------------

Nitrocid 0.2.0 introduces you to a whole new set of changes and features that
increase your productivity as you explore through the simulated operating
system with the introduction of the whole new look and feel, build system and
localization improvements, and other sets of improvements.

The whole new look and feel
---------------------------

We have redesigned the whole kernel from the very first screen that you see
right to The Nitrocid Homepage. The next time you start up Nitrocid, you'll
see those changes by yourself. From the modern look and feel to the futuristic
Figlet font that we have chosen. Not only that, but we've also changed the
log-in screen and the homepage screen to make them more consistent for better
transitioning from the splash screen to the homepage.

This was made possible with both changes to Nitrocid alone and changes made to
Terminaux, which resulted in two consecutive releases, which are version 7.0
to introduce many new features, such as radio button support for selection and
infoboxes and localization, and version 8.0, which brought back hidden
commands, as well as the keyboard cues. Changes that were made to Terminaux
have led to deduplication of the code by removing what was moved from Nitrocid
to Terminaux to make maintenance simpler.

Build system improvements
-------------------------

Since the release of the tech preview, we have improved the build system by
introducing build scripts to make building our projects frictionless. By
providing vendor scripts that the project authors make, and centralizing them
to a "vnd" directory, we are making the task of executing a set of complicated
tasks for build and other stages simpler and predictable.

Complete with support for command-line arguments for build systems, you can
pass arguments to the vendor scripts to make them behave differently,
depending on the requirements.

Localization improvements
-------------------------

All our libraries have now earned localization support due to LocaleStation,
but our plan fell short due to the large amount of code that was generated for
all locales, and this slowed down Nitrocid's performance during development of
0.2.0. However, using a new library, ResourceLab, and a combination of our
internal tools, we've managed to use a built-in .NET feature to store all the
strings that our libraries and applications use, called the .resx files.

As a result, localization has now become more reliable than never before,
because we have used localization IDs to translate different strings across
different applications and libraries, according to the current UI culture that
is configured on your system.

(Please note that when you select a language that is not supported by Nitrocid
even if it is listed in the kernel configuration, all strings default back to
English.)

Addons improvements
-------------------

We have improved how addons load by separating the important addons in their
separate folder from the optional addons in their separate folder. This was
done in an attempt to improve performance when starting up Nitrocid. Now, the
startup time takes far less than what the old separation method did: it loaded
all assemblies and checked their importance.

Essential addons can be found in the Addons.Essentials folder in the
application directory, while optional addons, which get loaded after loading
the main kernel configuration, can be found in the Addons folder in the
application directory.

Chatbot AI
----------

As artificial intelligence (AI) gets more and more attention towards companies
and other tech-related outlets, such as consumer computers, everyday
applications, and other technologies, we have included the Chatbot AI as an
optional addon for Nitrocid 0.2.0, which uses the OpenAI API to provide you
with ChatGPT models and other models, such as GPT-5.1 and 5.0.

This works like a conversation box that messenger applications use, except it
uses Terminaux's shell feature to provide conversation-style chatting with the
AI chatbot.

Please note that Chatbot AI requires that you are connected to the internet,
and that most of ChatGPT's models require a subscription. We are not
affiliated with OpenAI, and we aren't responsible for the misuse, so use the
chatbot responsibly.

2FA for Nitrocid users
----------------------

Two-factor authentication enhances your account's security by ensuring that
only you can access your account, even if an attacker used your password to
sign in to your account. Using authenticator applications like Google
Authenticator and Authy, two-factor authentication is possible by entering a
six-digit code to the code field to verify your identity.

Nitrocid makes this possible by implementing the two-factor authentication
system that supports the majority of authenticator applications, complete with
QR code support for authentication via your phone or your external device.
Even if your user account is protected by the password, there is another layer
of authentication that you'll need to complete before being able to sign in to
your account. This way, it makes sure that no attacker will be able to sign in
to your account using just the password.

Nitrocid.Rkm
------------

With the addition of new RPC commands, such as Version, VersionCode,
ApiVersion, and ApiVersionCode, we've made querying the version of Nitrocid
running on a remote computer that's running the RPC service. As a reminder,
the service is configured with UDP as the protocol and port 12345 as the
default port for the RPC feature.

Now, Nitrocid.Rkm makes remote controlling a remote Nitrocid instance within
your local area network (LAN) easier than never before. This is a command-line
interface application that allows you to remotely control a remote Nitrocid
instance, such as shutting it down, pinging it, and querying its version. You
can also test your connectivity to the remote Nitrocid instance.

To get started, you can use `ks-rkm-28 [arguments]` command on Nitrocid PPA
installations, or you can use `dotnet path/to/Nitrocid.Rkm.dll [arguments]` as
another method. The following switches change how Nitrocid.Rkm connects to the
Nitrocid RPC host:

  --verbose: Enables verbose logging and extra messages
  --help: Lists switches
  --host: Specifies the host name or IP address to connect to
  --port: Specifies the port number to connect to the host with
  --command: A single RPC command that you can pass to the host

By default, Nitrocid.Rkm runs on the default IP address, which is the loopback
interface address 127.0.0.1 (also known as localhost), and the default kernel
RPC port.

When --command is not specified, it defaults to the test command. This
acknowledgement message is always sent, regardless of the command, to verify
that Nitrocid.Rkm is connected to the correct Nitrocid host. One of the
following commands can be specified:

  - shutdown
  - reboot
  - rebootsafe
  - rebootmaintenance
  - rebootdebug
  - savescr
  - exec
  - ping
  - version
  - versioncode
  - apiversion
  - apiversioncode

Other changes
-------------

We have made some other changes made to Nitrocid, such as improvements to all
existing Nitrocid screensavers and the screensaver displayer, improvements to
the configuration verification stage, and all kinds of other changes that will
surprise you.

As for the legacy settings app, which used selection style, we've removed it
entirely as that was part of our plan to make the simulated kernel look more
consistent. It lacked features that made the newer settings app, which got
enhancements like switching configuration instances and a more natural flow
for SMultivar settings entries, easier to use.

version? Try it out today to explore them!
